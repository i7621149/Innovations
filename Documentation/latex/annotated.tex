\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_background}{Background} \\*Basically draws a quad fullscreen using whatever shader is set }{\pageref{class_background}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_entity}{Entity} \\*This class contains everything the shader library needs to use it it also has information about position, rotation and scale, and functions to change the shader an instance uses }{\pageref{class_entity}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_n_g_l_scene}{N\-G\-L\-Scene} \\*This contains the major management and drawing functions of our programs }{\pageref{class_n_g_l_scene}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_shader_lib_pro}{Shader\-Lib\-Pro} }{\pageref{class_shader_lib_pro}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_shader_pro}{Shader\-Pro} \\*Mostly used to add shaders and use shaders. simple interaction means it is easy to use }{\pageref{struct_shader_pro}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_shader_set}{Shader\-Set} \\*Shader\-Sets contain a vector of shaders and are responsible for managing them and making draw calls to Entities }{\pageref{class_shader_set}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_shader_variables}{Shader\-Variables} \\*This contains variables passed to the shader as uniforms, such as resolution, time, rendertime, frame number, mouse data and date it also contains the current material id and transform matrix its member variables are public for ease of use }{\pageref{struct_shader_variables}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_texture_data}{Texture\-Data} \\*This struct is used by \hyperlink{struct_shader_pro}{Shader\-Pro} and contains texture data like id, type, and the sourcefile }{\pageref{struct_texture_data}}{}
